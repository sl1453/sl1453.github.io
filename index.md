Welcome to Asteroid B-678! ü™ê (aka the website I finally taught myself to build ‚úåÔ∏è) 

I'm Shican (Claire), a Ph.D. üéì in biology from [Georgetown University](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014SkjDAAS/shican-li). I founded **[BioPath Analytica](https://BioPathAnalytica.github.io)** as a non-profit, web-based bio consultation business ‚Äî an experimental entrepreneurship project to gain real-life experience as a biologist and enrich my post-graduate journey in bioinformatics practices.  

I‚Äôm beginning my post-doc fellowship at Upenn while also preparing for the next stage of my career in China. I‚Äôll continue to share my adventures in science and beyond!

### Head to the [**About**](about) page, or visit the **menu tabs ‚òùÔ∏è** to dive in. (No snoozefests, pinky swear!)
