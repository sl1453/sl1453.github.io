Welcome to my little Asteroid B-678! 🪐

I'm Shican, my friends also call me Claire. I graduated with a Ph.D. 🎓 in biology from Georgetown University. Before you click away thinking it's all serious and science-y here, here’s why you might want to stick around a little longer!

Ever wondered what it's like to blend physics ⚛️ and biology 🔬 in the lab, teach with passion🦉, or transform experimental data into stunning visuals🌌 Or maybe you're curious about my artsy side👩‍🎨 or my influencer blog that fuses science with lifestyle tips🏄🏼‍♂️?

Well, don't just take my word for it. Head to the [**About**](about) page to dive in. I promise I won't overshare like I do with my friends.

P.S.: If you see this, it means I just taught myself website building. I'm including my scripts here for anyone interested!
